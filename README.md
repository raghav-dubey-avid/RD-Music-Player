Voice Enabled Music Player

You can control the music player by voice commands.
For example: (i) if you wanna go to previous song just long press the screen and say "play previous song" .
             (ii) if you wanna go to next song just long press the screen and say "play next song" .
             (iii) if you want to pause the song just long press the screen and say "pause" .
             (iv) if you want to play the song just long press the screen and say "play" .

You can also turn off the Voice Enabled mode and manually use the music player.
